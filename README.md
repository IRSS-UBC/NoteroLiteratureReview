# Notero Literature Review
A guide to using Notion and Zotero for a literature review.

Follow the [Installation Guide](https://github.com/IRSS-UBC/NoteroLiteratureReview/blob/main/README.md#installation-guide) to set up!

## Notero Literature Review Template
### 5 Key Areas of Template
  1. *The Cover Image* - You can change/reposition the cover by hovering over the image with your cursor and selecting the appropriate option.
  2. *The Database Title* - Feel free to change the title to whatever you want.
  3. *The Sheet Tabs* - All of these tabs are related to the **All Papers** tab just filted based on specific values which you can change as well.
  4. *The Fields* - These are the fields that hold relevant information to the literature. *Some of these are required for Notero to work so please do not delete any (you can hide tabs).*
  5. *The Items* - These will eventually be filled in with relevant information for each item added to the database. *Some of these fields will be automatically populated when you add items from Zotero.*

### Add Items to Database
After you have finished downloading and installing steps found in the [Installation Guide](https://github.com/IRSS-UBC/NoteroLiteratureReview/blob/main/README.md#installation-guide) you can now add items from Zotero to Notion. Recent updates to this have prevented Zotero from automatically adding items to Notion (if you figure out a fix let me know!). You can still manually add items by right-clicking on an item in Zotero and clicking **Sync to Notion**

### Literature Review Template
Once you have an item in the database you are able to open up the item to see all of the fields as well as any pages you have attached to them. To do this hover over the item of interest and click open.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/IRSS-UBC/NoteroLiteratureReview/blob/main/images/open_item.png">
</p>

In the panel that opens scroll to the bottom of the page and click **Literature Review**.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/IRSS-UBC/NoteroLiteratureReview/blob/main/images/add_page.png">
</p>

This will open up a template that you can use to help guide your review. Feel free to add anything you want or think is relevant as each time that you use this template for a new item it will start a fresh page.
